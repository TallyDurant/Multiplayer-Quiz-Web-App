# Multiplayer-Quiz

This project involves building a multiplayer quiz web application that allows users to create custom quizzes based on a variety of question types. The quiz takers will have different permissions based on the SQLite database and will be automatically graded by the MCQ marker or fuzzy text algorithm.

Description
The Multiplayer Quiz Web App is a web-based application that allows users to create custom quizzes based on various question types, including multiple-choice questions, true/false questions, and open-ended questions. Users can set different permissions for quiz takers, such as allowing or disallowing retakes, setting time limits, and selecting the grading algorithm.

The front end of the application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend was built using Python. The application uses SQLite as its database.

The application has two types of users: quiz creators and quiz takers. Quiz creators can create new quizzes, add questions to existing quizzes, and set quiz permissions. Quiz takers can view and take quizzes, and their answers will be automatically graded based on the selected algorithm.

The application uses an MCQ marker or fuzzy text algorithm to automatically grade quizzes. The MCQ marker algorithm is used for multiple-choice questions, while the fuzzy text algorithm is used for open-ended questions.
